<h2>Azure Services Used</h2>
<h3>Core Azure Services:</h3>
1. Azure App Service: Deployed the Python backend environment for text manipulation.<br>
2. Azure Cosmos DB: Leveraged as a MongoDB repository to store search history.<br>
3. Azure Static Web Apps: Hosted the front end of the website for user interaction.<br>
<h3>Azure AI Service</h3> 
1. Azure AI Translator Service: Utilized for text translation into multiple languages. <br>



<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p align="justify">In today's connected world, handling text effectively has become really important. People often need tools that can work with text in different ways, like changing its format, translating it, or summarizing it. But building software that can do all these things and still work well with a lot of text is not easy.</p>
<p align="justify">Text manipulation is about changing text to make it fit a specific purpose. Translation is turning text from one language into another, and summarization is about condensing text while keeping the important information.</p>
<p align="justify">For these tools to be useful, they need to handle large amounts of text and be able to handle even more as time goes on. They also need to work fast and accurately. Making these tools requires a lot of skill in writing software. But having these tools is really helpful for people and businesses, making communication and information management much easier.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p align="justify">
The Text Translator Website is an advanced platform providing various tools to make it easy for users to work with text in different ways. It's made using Python, a strong and scalable technology that ensures the website runs well and is reliable. The part of the website you interact with is hosted on Azure Static Web Apps, giving you a user-friendly interface for smooth navigation. When you search for something on the website, your search history is stored on Azure Cosmos DB. This is a special kind of database available all around the world, making sure your data is quickly and securely accessible. In simple terms, the website is a smart tool for handling text, designed to be easy to use, reliable, and secure.

In summary, the Text Translator Website is a comprehensive platform that provides users with a powerful set of text management tools, a robust and scalable backend, a user-friendly front end, and secure storage of user data. It is an ideal tool for anyone looking to manage their text quickly and efficiently.</p>
<b>Key Features :</b>
<ul>
    <li>Multilingual Translation: Utilizes Azure AI Translator Service to translate text into multiple languages</li>
    <li>Text Summary: Provides word and character summaries of inputted text.</li>
    </ul>
<b>Future Enhancements :</b><br>
<p align="justify">
Looking ahead, our project has exciting opportunities to grow. We plan to use advanced Azure Cognitive Services to understand text better, like figuring out feelings and picking out important phrases. We're also thinking about adding features that let people work together in real-time and personalize their experience. We want to make things work automatically and connect smoothly with other services using Azure Logic Apps or Functions. Making sure our platform can handle a lot of users and runs well is important, and we might even use machine learning to make text processing even better. We're also working on making it easy for other apps to work with ours and paying attention to things like making it accessible to everyone, adapting it for different languages, and listening to what users have to say to make it better. And of course, we're making sure it's super secure so everyone can trust their data is safe.</p>
